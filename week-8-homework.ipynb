If the p-value is below a predetermined threshold (e.g., 0.05), the insight is considered statistically significant.\nWhat is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important?\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution.\nImportance: It allows statisticians to make inferences about population parameters using sample data, even if the population distribution is not normal.\nWhat is statistical power?\n\nStatistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting a null hypothesis when it is false (avoiding a Type II error). Higher power indicates a greater ability to detect a true effect.\nHow do you control for biases?\n\nDesign studies carefully with randomization, blinding, and controlling confounding variables. Use robust statistical techniques and ensure sample representativeness.\nWhat are confounding variables?\n\nConfounding variables are external variables that influence both the independent and dependent variables, potentially leading to misleading associations.\nWhat is A/B testing?\n\nA/B testing is a method of comparing two versions (A and B) of a variable to determine which performs better. It's widely used in marketing and user experience optimization.\nWhat are confidence intervals?\n\nA confidence interval is a range of values derived from sample data that is likely to contain the true population parameter, with a certain confidence level (e.g., 95%).","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
